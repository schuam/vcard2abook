# vcard2abook

I want to use abook as my address book for Neomutt. The problem is that I
manage all my contacts in my google accout (contacts). The vcard file
I can export vom google contains all my contacts as a consecutive list of vcard
objects. The vcard2abook script converts the vcard file from google into an
addressbook file for abook.
